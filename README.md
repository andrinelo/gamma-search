### USER GUIDE

In this section the GUI is explained, detailing how the application can be used. Includes images with
numbered annotations in red, these red numbers are not part of the regular view but added in to more
accurately refer to specific parts of the views.

##### Main view
The view the user is shown at the start when they use the application is the main view. Main view may
change slightly, such as when relations are defined which causes a new dataset to show up in the graph
area.
